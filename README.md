# batch-scripts-for-general-utilities
This repo has batch scripts intended to be used by other batch scripts, such as printing in colour to the terminal.

# Usage
Typically, these are to be used by other sub-modules, such as batch-scripts-for-python-packages. And should typically be put in a "utils" subdirectory, so, to add this as a sub-module, run  
```
git submodule add https://github.com/Toast732/batch-scripts-for-general-utilities.git [dir/]utils
```
